Python's tuple comparison works element by element. `d.get(key) is None` evaluates to `True` if the key is missing (or its value is `None`), and `False` otherwise. Since `False` sorts before `True`, dictionaries with actual values for the key will sort before those with missing keys. The second element of the tuple, `d.get(key)`, then handles the actual value comparison for non-None items. For `None` items, `(True, None)` will correctly compare against other `(True, None)` tuples without error and retain their original relative order (stable sort).\n",
